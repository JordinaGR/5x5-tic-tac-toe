# Tic Tac Toe 5x5

This program has two modes, the easy and the hard. 

With the easy version, you are playing versus the machine and the machine chooses its move randomly.

With the hard version, the machine chooses its moves following some steps in order:

1. If the computer is at one move of winning, it chooses that move.

2. If the player is at one move of winning , it chooses that move.

3. If the computer is at two moves of wimming, it chooses one of those.

4. Same as step 3 but with the player.

5. Chose the center if it's not ocuped.

6. Same as step one, but if the computer is at 3 moves of winning.

7. Same as step 6 but with the player.
